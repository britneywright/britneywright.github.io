title: Unhappy Conf
---

I've been going to more conferences lately and always go through the same cycle. 

Pre-conference I'm nervous and anxious. What if I have no one to talk to? What if everyone is wondering why I'm there?

During the conference I'm high on life. Making friends, having great conversation. My voice usually starts to go out before the first day is over because I've talked more than I do in my lonely, everyday life. I leave the conference feeling inpsired, motivated and like I really can do anything.

Fast forward about 24 hours and I usually feel worse than ever. I feel like a fraud and like I'm not capable of anything. Everyone was just being nice and encouraging because that's what people are supposed to do at conferences. I question what I'm even doing, binge on bad food and don't touch any code because I feel unworthy. 

Conferences are not therapy. I need to remember that and stop treating them as such. They make me feel like my issues are solved and maybe they are, until I go back to reality. Reality is the problem and conferences are just an escape, not a solution.
