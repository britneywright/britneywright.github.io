Mixed bag this week. I've been staying at my mom's the past week since she live close to my work and the family can feed Jane and she can play in the backyard while I go to meetings in the evening. Let's just dive right in.

**Exercise more**

- **Workout for 15-30 minutes everyday.** According to Lift, which I've been using to track my fitness goals, I only worked out once last week. Yes I was busy last week, but not so busy that I couldn't fit workouts in. To start this week though I did get up before 6am, got out the door and 6 and alternated between running and walking for 30 minutes. We'll see if I can sustain that through the week.
- **30-day plank challenge.** Still on it. Up to 50 seconds on the front plank and 35 seconds on the side planks. Afraid to look ahead and see what the times will be by the end of the challenge.
- **30-day gladiator squats challenge.** I remember the second or third day when I had to do 40 squats and my legs were so tired. Yesterday I did 135 and it was no big deal. 140 is the goal today and I already did half this morning. Victory.

**Toss, restore, organize**

- **Clean or organize one thing before bed.** I did a pretty good job of washing all the dishes at night and generally picking things up. Slacked some at the end of the week. On Saturday night my mom helped me overhaul her mudroom though. We threw out a lot, took out some things, brought some things in, and now it's a craft room for one of my little sisters. I never remember to take before shots so then I don't bother taking after ones, but it turned out well. The room feels bigger, we put furniture from other parts of the house to good use, and most importantly my sister was thrilled to have a bigger space work on her projects. I think my mom is pleased also becuase my sister won't be leaving art projects and supplies all over the dining room table. 
- **Organize closets.** On deck for this week.
- **Check fridge once a week.** Before I left my house last Sunday I did a sweep of the fridge. I also managed to throw out some of the obviously old things from my mom's fridge while I've been there this week.

**Start the day off right**

- **Out of bed between 6:15 and 6:30.** I'm up, I'm up!
- **Drink hot water with lemon every morning.** This past week I learned that there are some things worth investing in, and one of those things is a good travel mug. I usually just grab whatever random freebie bottle I find and my lemon water goes from hot to lukewarm in about an hour. Last Monday I grabbed a Contigo mug from my mom's kitchen and that thing keeps my water hot for hours. I mean filled before 8 and still warm at 1! It's amazing. I can't find the exact one I'm using online, but it's similar to this [one](http://www.gocontigo.com/mugs/20-oz-autoseal-west-loop-stainless-travel-mug.html). If I can't take the one I'm using I'm definitely planning to buy one soon.
- **Do some exercise.** Doing my planks every morning, but that was about it last week.

**Don't leave things hanging**

- **Pay/cancel things on time** I definitely let some things slip through the cracks. Still haven't figured out Jane's dog license stuff because I haven't called to find out where I mail the check, even though I wrote it two weeks ago. 
- **Keep track of things** Things are on my radar, but not on my calendar yet.
- **Act now** I've been letting some things fester so I need to get caught up this week and then ahead.

Overall I'm a little disappointed in my week two self. But I've started this morning well and hopefully I can carry the momentum through the week and see some noticable improvements in my enviornment and mood.
