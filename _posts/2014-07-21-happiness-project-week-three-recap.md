Starting to really feel some mindset shifts and adjusting accordingly. Over halfway through the first month and the exersice goal is finally coming together. I really need to be more mindful about not leaving things hanging though.

**Exercise more**

- **Workout for 15-30 minutes everyday.** Finally broke through the mental wall and I'm exercising daily! Haven't missed a day since I got going last Monday. I'm still mostly doing a mix of walking and jogging outside, but I went to the gym a couple of times to do weights and cardio. In the back of my mind I already knew it, but exercising has really been the biggest impact on my energy levels so far. I have an extra pep in my step and now I look forward to it, rather than making excuses to avoid it. I've always enjoyed exercising when I get into a rhythm or routine so hopefully I'm back in that zone.

- **30-day plank challenge.** It's getting really now. Front plank is over one minute now and it's hard. It's mostly mental, but also physically challenging. Trying to find the right posture and focus to maintain the plank is key. If either is lacking it throws the other off and every second that ticks by begins to feel like an eternity.
- **30-day gladiator squats challenge.** Pretty much in beast mode here. Today I'll be doing 180 squats. The only thing is sometimes I think my count is off, but since I'm so motivated I do extra just in case.

**Toss, restore, organize**

- **Clean or organize one thing before bed.** Finally made it back to my casa last Monday night, but it's not looking or feeling as good as it should. I've stayed on top of my dishes and generally picking up after myself. I haven't done the extras though to improve my surroudings. Will double down on that this week. 
- **Organize closets.** Didn't get to it last week so looks like the time is now (or next week).
- **Check fridge once a week.** I haven't done real grocery shopping in a bit. Just buying enough to get me through every few days, so the fridge is looking good.

**Start the day off right**

- **Out of bed between 6:15 and 6:30.** I can't believe I'm saying this, but this morning I woke up at 5:30am. Of my own intention. Last week I woke up at 5:45am to exercise but I wasn't moving quick enough to get everything done in the morning and get to work by 7:30 like I'm aiming to. So last night I moved the alarm up 15 minutes and I have to say, it really didn't suck.
- **Drink hot water with lemon every morning.** After raving about the fancy mug last week, I have to report that I'm done with this goal. I like the hot water with lemon every so often for that cleasing feeling, but everyday it just becomes "blah". I don't think I finished my lemon water any day last week and so starting today I'm changing my aim to drinking 64oz of water a day. Most days I could easily go without drinking anything. I don't drink soda or coffee. Don't really like spending money on juices. And I don't enjoy water. But I know for just about every problem I have (dry hair and skin, acne, water retention, etc.) one of the first recommendations is to drink more water. So I'm just going to try to get through it as early in the day as possible, pee alot and hope for the best. 
- **Do some exercise.** Kicking ass and taking names. Got out the door at 5:45 this morning for 30 minutes of mostly jogging and some walking. 

**Don't leave things hanging**

- **Pay/cancel things on time** Yeah about that... 
- **Keep track of things** For real, for real I'm going to get on the calendar thing this week. I was listening to a podcast this week where someone said, "If you don't schedule it, it isn't real." I have all these things I want to do and that I need to remember to do. They'll eventually get done, but if I don't schedule them they won't get done as soon as they could or in the right priority.
- **Act now** Still not on this the way I should be. Spending more time in my head than being action oriented.
