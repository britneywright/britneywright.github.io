First month of my happiness project has come to an end. Took me a little longer than planned to get this post out. I was crazy busy this weekend participating in Ruby for Good.

The short answer would be no. I feel like I'm on a pendulum sometimes I'm going forward and sometimes I'm moving backwards, but overall I'm stuck in the same area. It's frustrating because I feel like I know what I want to accomplish but I'm just not getting there. In reality I actually did make a lot of progress on my resolutions this month

**Exercise more**

- **Workout for 15-30 minutes everyday.** It took me about two weeks to start exercising regularly, but now I seem to be on top of it. I need to improve my effort and duration though to really start feeling and seeing the benefits.
- **30-day plank challenge.** This got really difficult towards the end of the month. I also got heavier, so it was delightful having to hold myself for longer periods of time each day...not.
- **30-day gladiator squat challenge.** This was probably the most enjoyable goal of the month. I got excited each time I completed a larger set of squats and then to feel the burn the next morning was a great reminder of the effort I put in.

**Toss, restore, organize**

- **Clean or organize one thing before bed.** My cleaning and organizing was on a much larger scale earlier in the month, but overall it's starting to become a habit to tidy up before bed. Even washing a few dishes or throwing some things out and I feel a little better.
- **Organize closets.** I finally took the plunge and cleaned up my closets last week. I didn't feel like going through my clothes, but I did condense them to one closet and took everything out of my shoe closet that wasn't shoes or an accessory. I also got rid of five or six pairs of shoes, most of which I donated.
- **Check fridge once a week.** I don't know that checking the fridge has made me happy, but it has definitely reduced the anxiety I usually get after I've avoided cleaning things out for a long time. I also think it's saved me money because I'm more aware of my waste more often.

**Start the day off right**

- **Out of bed between 6:15 and 6:30.** For the most part I've gotten used to waking up early. I even got up at 6:30am this weekend, despite going to bed around 2am each night.
- **Drink 64 ounces of water everyday.** I just can't get myself to consume liquids on a regular basis. I've been filling and taking a water bottle around with me, but in most cases it loses it's contents more often as a result of condensation rather than my own consumption.  
- **Do some exercise.** I'm waking up early and working out, but as I said previously I need to put more into it. 

**Don't leave things hanging**

- **Pay/cancel things on time** Exciting news here. I paid off SallieMae, two years early! One student loan down, what feels like a million more to go.
- **Act now** I'm still about 50/50 on this. I'm getting better at pushing myself after a bout of procrastination (like writing this post) though. I'm still not responding to emails as quickly as I could and I'm still lingering on making decisions longer than necessary. 

So the first month is over and what have I learned about myself and my happiness? Well for one I've learned that I need to slow down on trying to do everything at once. I thought the goals I set were manageable, but I spent so much time thinking about everything I set out to do that I never really thought about whether it was making me happier. Did it relieve some of my stress? Yes. But did any of it make me happy? I'm doubtful. In fact, exercise has made me even more unhappy in some ways because I'm so out of shape. I can barely jog for more than a few minutes without getting extremely tired. Eventually if I keep at it I'll get back in shape, but the struggle right now is just as much mental as it is physical.

I still believe in the impact the happiness project can have, so I'm looing forward to what I accomplish in month two. August will be focused on areas that I hope will directly impact my happiness.
