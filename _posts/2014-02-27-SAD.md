title: SAD

At this point I can't tell if I have Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) or just "it's been cold too damn long" syndrome. Either way today I was not very productive. 

Part of it was the weather. Temps in the 30s. RealFeel in the teens for most of the day. Also interrupted by errands (picking up my new passport) and work (how dare people compensate me in exchange for my knowledge and time). But I did start going through Code School's [Rails for Zombies Testing](http://rtfz.codeschool.com/) course. I've written tests to varying degrees of success and using various tools before, but I don't think I've really spent a significant amount of time learning how to write tests to effectively practice Test Driven Development. Rails for Zombies Testing focuses on unit tests and then there's another course on rspec. I like working on basic unit tests as opposed to my current state of being lost in the weeds with a combo of rspec, FactoryGirl and Capybara. I started working on a job hunt/search/tracker app a few weeks ago and right now I have about 45 tests and most of them are failing despite my confidence that the app actually works. That's a pretty big red flag that my test writing skills are lacking. So as I'm going through the Rails for Zombies Testing course I'm writing unit tests in my app. When I finish both courses my test suite should be much improved.
