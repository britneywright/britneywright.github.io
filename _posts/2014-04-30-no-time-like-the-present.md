title: No time like the present (Picks Edition)

It's been about a month and a half since my last post. A lot has happened, a little has happened. I've been working, I've been coding, I've been to Russia (seriously!) and I've been getting fat :weary:. I'll expound on each of those at some point, but for now I'll share some of the things I've been enjoying and using to learn.

Games
* [Whatthecolor](http://leaverou.github.io/whathecolor/): Guess the rbg or hsl value of a color, while you're being timed. I'm pretty terrible, but can only go up from here!
* [Whatpx](http://georgehastings.com/ghastings3/whatpx/). Guess the width of an area.
* [CSS Diner](http://flukeout.github.io/). Great way to dive into CSS selectors and understand nesting.

Books
* [Learn to Program](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/) by Chris Pine.A book I should've read when I first started nearly a year ago.
* [Programming Ruby aka The Pickaxe Book](http://pragprog.com/book/ruby/programming-ruby) by Dave Thomas, with Chad Fowler and Andy Hunt. Actually got this months ago but I still go back to it all the time. Especially the Ruby Library Reference part that covers many Class methods and Instance methods with examples.
* [Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/book/chapter-5.html). This is another one that I think I should've read sooner. But I'm reading it now and really enjoying it. Love the humor and randomness of it all.
