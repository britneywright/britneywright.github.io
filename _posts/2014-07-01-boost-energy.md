Happy Canada Day! Also the official start of Rails Girls Summer of Code! And last, but certainly not least, the start of my happiness project!

For the month of July I've decided to focus my efforts on boosting my energy. Lack of energy is usually what deters me most from accomplishing things so I figured I should start there before working on other aspects of my life. I've created four resolutions and three goals for each.

**Exercise more**

In the past year I've gained about 30 pounds. I'm going to venture to say most of that has been due to my eating habits, but I've also been exercising much less frequently than I was in the year prior. Once incorporate fitness back into my routine I think I'll have an easier time checking myself on the food front.

- **Workout for 15-30 minutes everyday.** There was a time in the distant past where I worked out for at least 30 minutes a day and sometimes multiple times a day. That was back in college when I wasn't working 40 hours a week, sitting in traffic and doing a million other things. If I tell myself I have to work out for at least 30 minutes to make it worth anything I'll probably skip if I'm not feeling all that motivated. But saying "at least do something for 15 minutes" sounds doable and will likely turn into longer workouts once I'm out the door and feeling the workout high.
- **30-day plank challenge.** Found this on my Lift app. Start off doing one front plank for 20 seconds and a side plank for 15 seconds on each side. By the end of the month the goal is to work up to a 1:45 min front plank and 1 minute side planks on each side. Think this will be a good guage of how I'm progressing fitness wise.
- **30-day gladiator squats challenge.** Also found on the Lift app. This one takes you from 50 squats on day one to 250 squats on day 30.

**Toss, restore, organize**

- **Clean or organize one thing before bed.** Messes stress me out and weigh me down, yet my room always seems to be a disaster area. Instead of just letting things build up until I do a big clean, I'm going to make a better effort to spruce as I go and make at least one improvement to my surroundings before hitting the hay.  
- **Organize closets.** I get such a high when I organize my closets. It also makes getting ready much easier because I know what I have and can get to it easily. I have done a good closet overhaul in about a year and a half so this is long overdue.
- **Check fridge once a week.** I have a tendency to buy groceries or bring home leftovers and then forget about them. Then by the time I remember them I have no desire to touch them. Let's be honest, that's gross. So if I haven't eaten something in a week that is perishable I should just throw it out and, just like my closets, it will be easier to see what I have and make meal decisions. 

**Start the day off right**

- **Out of bed between 6:15 and 6:30.** Except on weekends. Early bird gets the worm and all that jazz.
- **Drink hot water with lemon every morning.** I've heard numerous times from a variety of sources that one of the best things you can do for yourself is drink hot water with lemon in the morning. It's supposedly good for digestion, your skin and has a number of other [benefits](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/03/17/lemon-water-benefits_n_4980265.html).It may also spur me to drink more water throughout the day.
- **Do some exercise.** One of my resolutions is focused solely on exercise, but doing all or part of it in the morning will really help wake me up mentally and physically. Also morning exercise usually puts me in a better mood because I feel like I've accomplished something right away. 

**Don't leave things hanging**

- **Pay/cancel things on time** The biggest mental/emotional strain on my life is bills. I tend to lose track of one off things like annual payments or services I don't use but I'm charged for on a recurring basis. I have most things on direct deposit which is good, but bad when i forget to cancel services and bad for things that come in that I can't setup on direct deposit. As I'm typing this I'm remembering I have to renew Jane's registration in my county and that mail has been sitting in my room for a week. Will get on it tonight.
- **Keep track of things** I have a lot going on right now and I'm doing a bad job of organizing myself to handle it all. I need to start putting dates in my calendar, setting reminders and making lists so I don't get overwhelmed.
- **Act now** Another source of stress and energy loss for me is being indecisive. I need to make decisions faster and get on with life rather than wasting valuable time debating things in my head or missing opportunities.

I haven't settled on what I'm going to use to keep track of my daily progress yet. I may load each goal into Lift since a couple are already there. A lot of people felt they were more succesful when they had a physical board or sheet to mark whether they met a goal or not. We'll see but so far I'm doing good. Had my water with lemon this morning, did my planks and 25 squats.

Until next time,
