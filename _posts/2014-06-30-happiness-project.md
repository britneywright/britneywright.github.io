In an effort to get my ish together I'm undertaking a happiness project. If you've read Gretchen Rubin's book [The Happiness Project](http://www.amazon.com/Happiness-Project-Morning-Aristotle-Generally/dp/006158326X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1404177722&sr=1-1&keywords=happiness+project) then you know all about it. But if you aren't familiar with it, then I'll give a quick overview. Each month I'll focus on different areas of my life that I want to improve by creating resolutions and setting actionable goals. I read the book well over a year ago, but it wasn't until a friend inquired about it recently that I figured it might be worth looking at again. Inspiration took hold over the weekend and tomorrow I'm starting my first month!

Why am I attempting a happiness project? Well for starters I've been pretty unhappy so it only makes sense that I try going in the opposite direction. I've been alternating between wallowing in my unhappiness or briefly trying to push myself out of it only to retreat further at the first sign of adversity or stress. I'm hoping that this project will help me put structure around areas of my life so I can build on the good and not crumble with the bad. Also I'm too broke to seek the services of a licensed mental health expert (hopefully address that challenge at some point in the project).

So far I've put together my ten commandments, wisdom that will help guide my decision making and effort through the project.

- **Celebrate**: I don't spend enough time enjoying my successes, which is a shame because the few times I do it gives me such euphoria. I recently co-organized a workshop to help women get started learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails. To see and hear how much our participants and volunteers enjoyed it gave me such a high. I felt on top of the world. I know I don't need praise from others to feel accomplished, I just need to celebrate any of my victories, event the smallest, and I can get that confidence boost.
- **Seek help**: I take too long to ask for help, or worse, I don't ask for it at all. I know there's a community of people willing to help when I'm confused, or stuck on just about anything, but only if they know I need them.
- **Always be learning**: As coincidence would have it (okay not really) this is also the name of my new [technical blog](http://www.alwaysbelearning.co). Spending the last year learning web development has taught me that I love learning and learning how to learn. I don't ever want to know all the things because it means I'm not challenging myself.
- **Stretch**: Not physically stretching, although I could probably stand to do that. Stretching as in pushing myself to spread beyond my comfort zone. Try new things. Embrace change. 
- **Paint it gold**: A favorite quote I heard a few years ago, "When life gives you lemons, paint that shit gold". Do more than the minimum. Take a setback and turn it into a opportunity.
- **Treat yourself**: I tend to skew on the frugal side and as a result I don't take care of myself the way I should. And in addition to basics I should find ways to occasionally enjoy this one life I have. 
- **Fake it till you make it**: I think my bad mood can be like a weed in a garden. Slowly spreading and taking over everything in it's path. I'm not saying I should just get over myself, but if I try being more positive and even one time out of 100 it makes me feel better, then I think it's worth it. Also, another way to think about this one is that I never feel 100% confident about the things I do. Maybe I will one day, but I can't wait until that day comes to then feel like I'm good enough. I need to take risks, like applying for jobs before I think I'm ready in order to really see that I'm ready or push me where I need to be.
- **Sharing is caring**: I already do a much better job of looking out for others more than myself, and want to continue doing what I can with what I have, and more as I find the means.
- **Teamwork makes the dream work**: More than anything I want to be a part of a team of some sort. I spend most of my time learning alone, working alone, living alone (well except for Jane Dog), but not for lack of effort. It seems like it hasn't been in the cards for me, but I'm going to try even harder to change that.
- **Let it go**: I need to learn how to not take things as personally as I do sometimes. I sometimes have that feeling that people don't care about me and let it weigh on me, but in reality if they don't care about me why should I spend time caring about that. Let it go. Let go of those people that don't bring value to my life and the unnecessary worry I place on myself. 

So there you have it, my ten commandments. Tomorrow I'll reveal my first area of focus, my resolutions and my goals for the month of July.

Happy times ahead!
