Overall I'm off to a pretty good start in week one of my project.

**Exercise more**

- **Workout for 15-30 minutes everyday.** This is the one weak spot. I only managed to go for a short jog one day this week. I was deterred by a mix of willpower, heat and rain.
- **30-day plank challenge.** Going strong with these. I do them right after I walk Jane in the morning.
- **30-day gladiator squats challenge.** Haven't missed a day yet. I started doing them all at once, but as the number of squats increase each day I'm breaking them into two or three sets throughout the day.

**Toss, restore, organize**

- **Clean or organize one thing before bed.** This has been the biggest boost for me. I'm to the point where I'm seeking things i can wash, toss, or organize. And not just before bed, but throughout the day. It feels good to improve my surroundings.
- **Organize closets.** I probably won't get to this until the third week of the month since I won't be home much this week.
- **Check fridge once a week.** Discovered and through out some carrots I bought weeks ago. And yesterday I realized the mushrooms I bought on Monday were already going bad, so I immediately tossed them.

**Start the day off right**

- **Out of bed between 6:15 and 6:30.** Getting up is the easy part. Getting going is still a work in progress.
- **Drink hot water with lemon every morning.** Drinking my water as we speak. Still searching for that small window between scalding and room temperature though.
- **Do some exercise.** If I count the planks and squats I'm doing good, but let's be honest, not really. Need to summon the willpower and make the time.

**Don't leave things hanging**

- **Pay/cancel things on time** About 50/50 here. Paused one account immediately. Still haven't sent off Jane's registration. Need to call and confirm the address I'm supposed to mail to.
- **Keep track of things** Fell victim to lack of keeping track this week. Haven't started using my calendar but know I need to.
- **Act now** The good news is I did act on something right away this week. The bad news is it relates to the keeping track of things so unfortunately I now have to withdraw myself from an opportunity I originally accepted due to a scheduling conflict.

Overall I'm feeling good about where I'm at. I know I need to push myself to exercise so I get the physical energy boost in addition to the mental boost I'm getting by creating more pleasant spaces for myself.
