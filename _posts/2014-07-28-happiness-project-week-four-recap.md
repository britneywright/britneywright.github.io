Closing in on the end of month one with noticeable improvements in most areas.

**Exercise more**

- **Workout for 15-30 minutes everyday.** I'm officially in the zone. I woke up at 5:30am during the week Monday-Thursday to workout. Unfortunately I stayed up too late Wedneday and Thursday so I overslept Friday morning, but I worked out in the evening and worked out over the weekend too. My level of intensity with these workouts leaves a lot to be desired, but the consistency is a step in the right direction.

- **30-day plank challenge.** The plank challenge is at impossibly hard levels right now. one minute, 45 second front planks and one minute side planks. I can't get through them without fidgeting, adjusting from elbow to hand position, and taking one or two second breaks here and there. Today is the last day. I can't say that I've really gained anything out of it strength wise. It was more about saying I was going to do something and sticking with it for the full time.
- **30-day gladiator squats challenge.** Got up to 230 squats yesterday. Had a fun time with my mom and sisters analyzing my squat form. The key is not to look down or my form goes to hell and my squat looks more like bending over. Concentrating on my form definitely improved the impact of my squats. My legs burned sooner and I still yesterday's this morning.

**Toss, restore, organize**

- **Clean or organize one thing before bed.** Stayed up way too late last night cleaning and putting away laundry but it felt good this morning not searching through a pile of wrinkled clothes for socks and that sort of thing. I also cleared off all the counter tops in my room by putting everything into one bag which I'll go through this evening.
- **Organize closets.** Seriously, this is the final countdown. Tomorrow or bust. I'm going to try to take before and after pictures to motivate the reorganization and purging.
- **Check fridge once a week.** I got so distracted cleaning my room yesterday that I didn't inspect the fridge. I'll get on this one today.

**Start the day off right**

- **Out of bed between 6:15 and 6:30.** I'm feeling good about waking up at 5:30 now, but I'm still not getting up and out the door fast enough. I think I should be out the door to workout by 5:40, not 5:45 or 5:50 like I have been most days. The key there will be getting to sleep at a reasonable hour.
- **Drink 64 ounces of water everyday.** This goal was modified from my hot water with lemon everyday goal. And I've pretty much fallen off of this as well. It takes so much conscious effort for me to consume liquids. But maybe it will be like the exercise and after a couple of false starts I'll get into a groove.  
- **Do some exercise.** Now that I'm finally in a rhythm of exercise to start my day I'm ready to push my effort levels to something worth being up early for. 

**Don't leave things hanging**

- **Pay/cancel things on time** Not really anything to do this week on this one. 
- **Keep track of things** Finally sent in Jane's registration last week. Fingers crossed I don't have any issues with that.
- **Act now** This was a big improvement over the previous weeks. I'm responding to emails more promptly. Deciding what things I should handle right away or delegate to a later time. I still have a lot to improve, but I definitely felt like I'm more effective when I don't have as many decisions or actions weighing on me.

July ends on Thursday so while I'm working on ending the month strong, I also need to start planning my resolutions and goals for August. I was going to focus on money, but I tend to let that weigh on me every second of every day, so instead I'm considering an area that I think will have a more direct and positive impact on my happiness.
