The long weekend recharge has done me some good. I took a Saturday off from coding which gave me a lot of perspective. Everytime I get stuck and stressed I equate my struggles with greater failures in work and life. Taking a conscious day off allowed me to take stock of everything else I could be doing and the amount of pressure I could take off of myself. In that spirit I've decided to focus the month of September on creativity.

I'm not going to stop coding, but I'm going to make a bigger effort to do other things that allow me take a stress break and flex my mind in other ways.

**Picture a day**

Photography is someting I've been interested in since I got my first digital camera in high school. But my actual photo taking has come and gone in waves. The rate probably matches the rate of my overall happiness. I got a dSLR a few years ago and even took a photography class to better understand some of the settings on it. But I quickly forgot the techniques and tips and I don't make use of the camera like I know I could. I'm going to take photos everyday to become better acquainted with my camera, but also to make sure I'm taking note of life around me. I zone out on everything sometimes, I'm sure I miss moments that might be worth capturing.
Here's a picture I took today while walking Jane after it rained:

**Blog twice a week**

I need to write more. For one, my sentence structure is probably terrible at this point. I also need to do a better job of articulating my thoughts and not leaving everything to fester or disappear in my head.

**Cook once a week**

It's kind of a sad goal to cook just once a week, but I've completely dropped the ball here. I've been spending a lot of money grabbing food from places as I'm hungry. And I miss baking. I miss it so much, but I've had such a dread about doing it, but I don't know why. Making banana bread this weekend was so relaxing. And tonight I made [chili mac](http://potluck.ohmyveggies.com/chili-mac/) and it was not only good, but I felt good about the fact that I made it and didn't buy it somewhere. I'm not foolish enough to think I'll cool all the time, but I think by taking the baby step of at least once a week I could build up enough confidence and enthusiasm to do it more often.

**Experiment with code**

The reason I decided to learn to program was because I enjoyed researching and hacking web features more than I enjoyed project management. Yet somehow over the last year I've completely lost track of that passion and excitement. If I can code just to code and not associate it with work, or money, or anything I think I'll be in a better position to learn and grow.
