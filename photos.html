    <p>I used the macro setting to capture the leaves after it rained.</p>

    <p>There wasn't enough light for my camera on Tuesday night so I made the shutter speed really slow and waved around the camera to create this warped effect with the light.</p>

    <p>I had a meeting in downtown DC on Thursday. I love the angle of the building and the spacing of the cars.</p>

    <p>I was stuck in traffic and happened to stop underneath one of those big overhead signs. From this angle it's hard to tell what it is and I think that makes it interesting.</p>

    <p>I was excited to take pictures of the rain, but my battery was dead. I took this post-rain angled shot of my rain soaked balcony. Pleasantly surprised the plants are still alive and I love the out of focus string lights.</p>

    <p>I took this at movie theatre by my house. From this angle it looks retro, but in reality the clock and movie theatre marquee don't really match the standard strip mall feel of the rest of the businesses on the block.</p>

    <p>Jane is always trying to get my food. Made carrot fries for the third straight night.</p>
